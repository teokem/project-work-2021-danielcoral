# COMPUTE Project - Discordant variant analysis

Obesity is closely linked to T2D, but this relationship is highly heterogeneous. Some individuals with obesity do not have the expected increase in T2D risk. In the contrary, some individuals develop T2D despite being consistently lean. In this project we identify the main phenotypic differences between two genetically determined obesity profiles: one that also increases T2D risk (concordant) vs one that decreases T2D risk (discordant). Knowing what factors uncouple obesity from its cardiometabolic risk may aid in improving current diagnosis, stratification and interventions in obesity.
